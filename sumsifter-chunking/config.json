        "documentText": "Cybersecurity Report.  Since the beginning of the calendar year, Palo Alto Networks has detected an uptick in Maze ransomware samples across multiple industries. As a result, we've created this general threat assessment post on the Maze ransomware activities and full visualization of these techniques can be viewed in the Unit 42 Playbook Viewer. Maze ransomware, a variant of ChaCha ransomware, was first observed in May 2019 and has targeted organizations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. This ransomware is typically distributed via emails containing weaponized Word or Excel attachments. However, it has also been distributed via exploit kits such as the Spelevo Exploit Kit, which has been used with Flash Player vulnerabilities CVE- 2018-15982 and CVE-2018-4878. Maze ransomware has also utilized exploits CVE-2019-11510 (Pulse VPN), as well as CVE-2018-8174 (Internet Explorer) to get into a network. The malware first establishes a foothold within the environment. It then obtains elevated privileges, conducts lateral movement, and begins file encryption across all drives. However, before encrypting the data, these operators may exfiltrate the files to be used for further coercion, including public exposure. Without the proper protections in place, a Maze ransomware infection will cripple normal business operations, and sensitive information will be compromised, resulting in a monetary loss. Maze has not only been observed globally, but also affecting varying industries, which include: finance, technology, telecommunications, healthcare, government, construction, hospitality, media and communications, utilities and energy, pharma and life sciences, education, insurance, wholesale, and legal. On March 26, 2020, McAfee published a report providing a detailed overview of the Maze ransomware. Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR contains an Anti- Ransomware Protection module, which targets encryption-based activities associated with ransomware. Customers can also review activity associated with this Threat Brief via AutoFocus. Recently, malicious operators behind the Maze ransomware activities compromised multiple IT service providers. These operators were also able to establish a foothold within another victim's network through insecure Remote Desktop Protocol and other remote service connections or by brute-forcing the local administrator account. Organizations should be mindful of potential compromises through third-party sources and ensure strong passwords are used for all systems capable of remote access. It was also reported that Maze operators pay special attention to cloud backups on the compromised network. If the operators were to obtain login credentials, they are then able to download all backup data to an actor controlled server. Organizations should ensure that all cloud backup files are properly stored and protected."

Their key demands, as understood from various sources, include the removal of Marshal Salazar, the restoration of the Zendian Republic, and the establishment of a democratic government. They also demand the cessation of human rights violations and the release of political prisoners. These demands, while justifiable from a human rights perspective, pose significant challenges to the peace talks. The Salazar regime, known for its ruthless tactics and unyielding control, is unlikely to accede to these demands without significant concessions. The ZLB's insistence on Salazar's removal could potentially derail the talks if not handled diplomatically. The ZLB's demands for the restoration of the Zendian Republic and the establishment of a democratic government are in line with the international community's expectations. However, the implementation of these demands would require a complete overhaul of the current political system in Zendia, which Salazar is unlikely to accept without a fight. The demand for the cessation of human rights violations and the release of political prisoners is a significant sticking point. The Salazar regime has been notorious for its suppression of political dissent, and it is unclear how willing they would be to release political prisoners. The outcome of these peace talks is uncertain, but it is clear that the demands of the ZLB will play a significant role in shaping the future of Zendia. "

        "documentText": "News Article HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong protesters plan to rally on Thursday evening to show solidarity with people demonstrating in Spain's wealthiest region of Catalonia over jail sentences handed out to nine separatist leaders. The protests in Catalonia share some noticeable comparisons with the demonstrations in Hong Kong, where millions have taken to the streets for five months to vent their anger over what they see as Beijing's tightening grip on the city. Most protesters in Hong Kong want greater democracy, among other demands, although a small minority are calling for independence, a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing. Independence is also a highly divisive issue in Catalonia, which, like Hong Kong, has more than 7 million inhabitants, its own language, parliament and flag. Slideshow by Photo Services. Some demonstrators waved the Catalonian flag at a protest in Hong Kong on Sunday, while activists in Spain's northeastern region have adopted some of the tactics used by people in the Chinese-ruled city. Students in Catalonia have boycotted classes, while protesters there have focused on strategic targets to cause maximum disruption, including the international airport serving Barcelona - similar to strategies used by Hong Kong activists. Catalonian demonstrators are angry at what they see as attempts to thwart their desire for greater autonomy from the rest of Spain, fears that resonate with many protesters in the former British colony of Hong Kong. Some Hong Kong protesters are going online ahead of the demonstration to urge people not to attend, saying it is too provocative and risks denting international support for their cause. Hong Kong authorities formally banned a group promoting independence from China in September last year, the first outlawing of a political organization since the handover. Under the terms of the 1997 handover from Britain, Hong Kong was allowed to retain extensive freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China under a \"one country, two systems\" formula, including an independent judiciary and right to protest. However, many Hong Kong residents are angry at what they see as a relentless march towards mainland control. Hong Kong's legislature formally withdrew on Wednesday planned legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, a bill that triggered the unrest, but the move was unlikely to end the protests because it met just one of the pro-democracy demonstrators' five demands.(Reporting by Anne Marie Roantree; Editing by Paul Tait)"

        "documentText": "Technical Paper Excerpt In this section, we focus on analyzing the literature pertain- ing to activity detection and recognition using wireless signals. A. Human Activity Recognition Based on the relationship between activity characteristics and location, the authors in [22] develop a location-oriented activity recognition system, which can distinguish between different in-place activities, such as washing dishes and walk- ing. Wei et al. [23] consider the impact of radio frequency interference on CSI measurements and use several counter- measures to mitigate this impact to further improve the activity recognition performance. Unlike [22] and [23], Li et al. [24] propose a location-free activity recognition system, which first estimates the angle difference of arrival and then uses a trained Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to complete recognition. In CARM [25], the authors propose a CSI-speed model to quantify the relation between CSI dynamics and hu- man movement speeds. Then, they build a CSI-activity model to quantify the relation between human movement speeds and activities, so as to recognize daily activities via a Hidden Markov Model. Besides activities, CSI can also be used for subtle motion detection. For example, WiCatch [26] estimates and tracks the relative AoA of hand-induced reflection and accomplishes gesture recognition via a trained support vector machine (SVM) classifier. PhaseBeat [27] provides an analysis of the CSI phase difference data with respect to its stability and periodicity, and uses root-MUSIC and fast Fourier transform (FFT) to estimate the breathing frequencies and heart rates of multiple individuals. B. Human Fall Detection The first fall detection work using commodity WiFi devices is believed to be WiFall [28]. WiFall first extracts signal features, such as normalized standard deviation and signal entropy, from CSI amplitude, through CSI aggregation, outlier removal, and singular value decomposition. Then, the SVM and Random Forests classifiers are trained to classify different human activities and achieve fall detection. Unlike WiFall, RT- Fall [29] uses the CSI phase difference over two antennas and determines the sharp power profile decline pattern of the fall in the time-frequency domain. Leveraging these observations, RTFall segments the CSI data stream and extracts features, such as median absolute deviation and signal change velocity, to train the SVM classifier for fall detection. Different from the above works, which only considers features in the time domain, FallDeFi [30] uses the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to extract time-frequency features and the sequential forward selection algorithm to single out features that are resilient to changes in the environment. Then, these features are used to train a classifier for fall detection. Recent works Wispeed [21] and Defall [16] establish a link between the auto- correlation function of the CSI and the speed of a moving human. Through this, they can estimate the velocity of the moving human and accomplish fall detection by analyzing the change in the estimated velocity. Different from the previous work, in this paper, we establish a more accurate relationship between the phase accumulation between two adjacent CSI data packets and the velocity and acceleration of DPLC. On this basis, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate velocity and acceleration from CSI directly. At last, we evaluate the acceleration estimation performance and use the fall detection as an example to illustrate the importance of acceleration estimation in wireless sensing."
