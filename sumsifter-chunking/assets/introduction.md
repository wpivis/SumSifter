## Project Objective

The goal of this survey is to get a sense of how analysts break down a text document into information chunks. To us, an information chunk is a string of words that provide a new piece of information along with its supporting context in the document, it is not a specific term. These chunks can be as long or short as you want and punctuation does not have to be considered. We want to get a sense for how an analyst deconstructs a document to inform how we can create better summaries. 

There is no right or wrong way to do the following task, we really just want to see how you as an analyst identify new pieces of information.

We estimate this survey will take around **15** minutes. When youâ€™re ready, go ahead and click **NEXT** to see instructions on the next page.
