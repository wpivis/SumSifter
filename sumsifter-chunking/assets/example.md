## Instructions
In this survey we’d like you to read texts and add marks to break each text up into information chunks.

Create a new chunk anytime you think new information is introduced in a text. Information chunks can be as specific or general as you want. To create information chunks in the text, click anywhere in the text and a blue mark will appear ( ). These marks will act as the boundaries of each information chunk. Line breaks and punctuation marks are in the text, but they aren’t considered chunk boundaries unless you add a blue mark because you want them to be a boundary. You can remove a mark by clicking on it again.
