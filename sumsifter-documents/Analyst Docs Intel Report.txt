The Zendian Liberation Brigade (ZLB) has been a significant force in the political landscape of Zendia. Their key demands, as understood from various sources, include the removal of Marshal Salazar, the restoration of the Zendian Republic, and the establishment of a democratic government. They also demand the cessation of human rights violations and the release of political prisoners. These demands, while justifiable from a human rights perspective, pose significant challenges to the peace talks. The Salazar regime, known for its ruthless tactics and unyielding control, is unlikely to accede to these demands without significant concessions. The ZLB's insistence on Salazar's removal could potentially derail the talks if not handled diplomatically. The ZLB's demands for the restoration of the Zendian Republic and the establishment of a democratic government are in line with the international community's expectations. However, the implementation of these demands would require a complete overhaul of the current political system in Zendia, which Salazar is unlikely to accept without a fight. The demand for the cessation of human rights violations and the release of political prisoners is a significant sticking point. The Salazar regime has been notorious for its suppression of political dissent, and it is unclear how willing they would be to release political prisoners. The outcome of these peace talks is uncertain, but it is clear that the demands of the ZLB will play a significant role in shaping the future of Zendia.
