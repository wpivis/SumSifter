## SumSifter Design Survey

Estimated study time: 10 minutes.

Welcome! What you are about to do is not a real experiment.   
It is just a survey that looks like an experiment.

We are testing our platform, interaction capabilities, and data collection.  

**We also need your help!**

We are mainly looking for your input and ideas.  
Feel free to poke around, explore, and comment as ideas come to you.

Note: there will be a few summary analysis examples, a break, and then a few design feedback trials.

Thanks!  
-- The SumSifter Team
