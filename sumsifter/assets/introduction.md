## SumSifter Design Survey


Welcome! What you are about to do is not a real experiment.   
It is just a survey that looks like an experiment.

We are testing our platform, interaction capabilities, and data collection.  

**We also need your help!**

You will encounter a few (about 5) sample summary reading tasks, and then a few design feedback trials.  
More on those in a moment.

In general though, we are mainly looking for your input and ideas.  
Feel free to poke around, explore, and comment as ideas come to you.

We believe that the final design may look quite different as the weeks go forward.
