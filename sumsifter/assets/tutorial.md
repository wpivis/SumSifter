## Tutorial

### Summary Tasks
You will have a few summary and source pairs to compare.  
While you go through these, please also think about what the task **should** be.
Like, what experiment should we actually be running?

We can change many details: the source links, the datasets, the number of summaries, sources, and so on.  
What we need to hear are ideas on what types of studies we might run that would be valuable to SCADS stakeholders.

### Design Feedback Tasks
We also have a few additional trials which are simply for you to provide feedback on and to riff on images of potential future experiments.  
Simply view and comment however you wish.

...and that's it! Thanks for your help!
