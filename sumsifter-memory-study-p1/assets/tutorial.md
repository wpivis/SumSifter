## Tutorial

### Summary Tasks (First Set)
You will have about 5 summary and source pairs to compare.  
While you go through these, please also think about what study we **should** be running.

We can change many details: the source links, design elements, the datasets, the number of summaries, number of sources, and so on.  
We just need your feedback at this stage.


### Design Feedback Tasks (Second Set, following a break)
The second set of trials will present a design mockup.
Simply view and comment however you wish.

...and that's it! Thanks for your help!
