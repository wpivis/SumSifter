## SumSifter Design Survey

Estimated study time: 30 minutes.

On the next page, you’ll see a list of documents. You can click on each one to open
it to the side and read it. You can go back and forth between documents but can
only see one at a time.

Imagine these documents are from a coworker, you’ve been passed a project of
theirs that is half-finished. Thus, some of the documents are summaries, some are
highlighted texts, and some are just full texts. 

All of the documents are generally about **X**. You only have **30 minutes** to read over the documents, and then tomorrow you’ll be asked to remember what you read today. 

Thanks!
