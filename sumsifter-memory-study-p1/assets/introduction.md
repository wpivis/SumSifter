On the next page, you’ll see a list of documents. You can click on each one to open it to the side and read it. You can go back and forth between documents but you can only see one at a time.

Imagine it’s 2020 and you’ve been passed a project from a coworker that is half-finished. Thus, some of the documents are summaries, some are highlighted texts, and some are just full texts. All of the documents are generally about space technology and news and the goal of this project has been to find what innovations are being made, particularly to support NASA’s mission to go to the moon and Mars. 

<br>You only have **15 minutes** to read over the documents, and then tomorrow you’ll be asked to remember what you read today.

<br>**Please do not take notes while you read these documents.**<br><br>
