1. It not very clear to me what the numbering means for each source. 
2. When there are multiple sources assigned to one sentence, it can be challenging to understand which source contribute to the exact portion of the summary, then it leads to longer time to read through the actual document. 
3. Some attributed sources are not correct, for example S15, for the second to the last sentence, not sure if this is intentional. 
4. I'm kind of curious to see at what point an analyst will click on the source and verify it themselves. If they need to click through every one of them, it's too much effort. This probably has to do with the data that's used here. Since I'm familiar with the SCADS document, so reading through the summary is quite easy and I don't need to verify their sources. But if it's a very technical article in chemistry, for example, then I have this natural suspicion that makes me want to probably click everything to see the source...
5. Also, there's no time constraint for me when interacting with this, but will people pay less attention to the sources if they are under pressure?

Now, every sentence in the summary has labeled sources. What if analysts have the choice to click on the sentence and request a source?

It does allow me to consider how accurate the summary sentence with regards to the source. For example, the sentance ""Techniques like VideoGPT..."" referenced S54 which does not appear to be accurately reflected in the summary.

I do think that the links feel a bit distracting to overall readability of the summary.  Maybe something like a hover over to expand or some other way of hiding the source data when reading the summary would make it overall easier to read.

I'm curious if there's a better way to actually summarize such a long document.  It almost feels like I'm missing a lot of information and, at the same time, not confident that the summary captures the key points accurately. I wonder if some way of segmenting the document before summarization (maybe then summarize that section) would improve understanding of the source.

I have no way to tell what type of information was not captured in the summary. Having the sources allows me to verify information (enhancing trust). At the same time, having the source document visible in full makes me question how many key points were missing from the summary.

Assuming a case with some retrieval step used before generating the summary, it would be interested to think about how to display some insight into which sections were retrieved/why something was retrieved. Not sure how to visualize that, but it would also help to understand which information may not have been considered (or could contradict something stated in the summary).

It seems to provide both relevant information to the query while allowing an analyst to ""dig in"" to the details when necessary or applicable. 

From an overall efficiency perspective, I wonder if there are more effective ways to display the initial summary.  For example, how similar will every summary end up (ex. ""D2 provides an overview..."" ""D5 delves into..."")? Maybe there are some form of outline-like summary that might make an analysts job more efficient.
When trying to quickly digest and determine applicability, it may be better to just plop the details in front of me instead of making me read some elegant summary. While it might read easier, it also may just take extra time without providing any actual value to the reader.

D3 and D7 are not even referenced in the overall relevance section. If you are grouping them already into sections, maybe move the group relevance to the actual section of those documents (ie. Documents D2, D5 and D9..."" could be moved to the section containing those docs while D3 and D7 would have its own intro on what that group means).

I wonder if there is anything that could be said about differences between grouped results such as what is not covered in one set but is covered in another set. Similarly within documents in a group. This would allow an analyst to see what was unique of different between individual documents.

Is there a way to update the search parameters or relevance scoring based on the list of results/document summary/source? For example, could I highlight a section in the source document or summary of a document to add it into the original search parameters and/or refine the summary with more info like the selected text.
