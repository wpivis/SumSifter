Great! Next we will do the second step. We will show you one sentence at a time and ask you to identify if it is something that you remember seeing in the documents we showed you yesterday. 

Important note: each sentence is either the “gist” of something that was in the previous documents OR something that absolutely was not in the documents. There will be no “trick questions” where one keyword has been swapped. Please do not worry if you think the statement is a rephrasing of what you read, consider that correct. 

If you are unsure, please make your best guess.

You have as much time as you like for this step, but please do not pause and come back to this task, if possible. Please click **Start** when you are ready.
