**Great!** Next we will do the second step. We will show you one sentence at a time and ask you
to identify if it is something that you remember seeing in the documents we showed you
yesterday.

**Important note:** each sentence will either be verbatim something you did see OR something
that absolutely was not in the documents. There will be no trick statements that are just
paraphrased or slightly altered.

If you are unsure, please **guess**.

You have as much time as you like for this step, but please do not pause and come back to
this task, if possible. 

Please click **Begin** when you are ready.
